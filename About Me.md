Hi! I’m Laica Mae C. Semila, a 3rd Year BSIT student at New Era University.  
I’ve always been curious about how technology works, from websites and apps to how data travels across networks and stays secure.  

I created this repository to store my personal notes for various subjects and lessons I’ve learned throughout my studies.  
Sometimes it can be challenging to understand everything right away, especially when topics get technical,  
but I actually find it exciting to see how much I improve week by week.  

This repository also serves as one of my projects for Information Assurance and Security (IAS).  
It’s not just about writing notes, it’s about showing how I apply what I’ve learned in organizing, protecting, and managing information effectively.  
By documenting my learnings here, I can track my growth, review past lessons, and hopefully inspire other IT students like me to stay consistent in learning.
